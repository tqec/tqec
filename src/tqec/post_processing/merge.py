    This function merges moments from the provided ``circuit`` that can be

    may re-organise the neighbourhood of ``REPEAT`` blocks in some cases, but
    the returned circuit should always be strictly equivalent to the provided

        circuit: a circuit containing moments that may be mergeable.

    Returns:
        a new quantum circuit that contains strictly the same instructions as
        the provided ``circuit`` but that might re-order some of these operations
        to reduce the number of moments.
