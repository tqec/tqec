    This function generate the `stim.Circuit` instances for all the combinations
    of the given `ks` and `ps` with a noise model that depends on `p` and
    computed with `noise_model_factory`.

    It is equivalent to:

            for k in ks:
                yield (

                )

    except that the order in which the results are returned is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        compiled_graph: computation to export to `stim.Circuit` instances.
        ks: values of `k` to consider.
        ps: values of `p`, the noise strength, to consider.
        noise_model_factory: a callable that builds a noise model from an input
            strength `p`.
        manhattan_radius: radius used to automatically compute detectors. The
            best value to set this argument to is the minimum integer such that
            flows generated from any given reset/measurement, from any plaquette
            at any spatial/temporal place in the QEC computation, do not
            propagate outside of the qubits used by plaquettes spatially located
            at maximum `manhattan_radius` plaquettes from the plaquette the
            reset/measurement belongs to (w.r.t. the Manhattan distance).
            Default to 2, which is sufficient for regular surface code. If
            negative, detectors are not computed automatically and are not added
            to the generated circuits.
        detector_database: an instance to retrieve from / store in detectors
            that are computed as part of the circuit generation.

    Yields:
        a tuple containing the resulting circuit, the value of `k` that
        corresponds to the returned circuit and the value of `p` that corresponds
        to the returned circuit.
