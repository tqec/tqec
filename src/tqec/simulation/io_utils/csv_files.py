        stats: List of simulation results. Each element corresponds to a line in a csv file.
        if_file_exists: How to react if ``filepath`` points to an existing file.

            - overwrite: Effectively delete the file and pretend none exists.
            - merge: Read the file and try to match entries with the simulation data from ``stats``
                by strong id. In case of a match merge the entries.
