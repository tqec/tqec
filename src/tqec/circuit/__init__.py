"""Defines core classes and functions to represent and manipulate quantum
circuits.

This package defines the core class :class:`~schedule.circuit.ScheduledCircuit`
that is used to represent a quantum circuit in the `tqec` library. It also
defines a few core functions:

- :func:`~.generate_circuit` that takes a :class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template`
  instance and a description of plaquettes via a
  :class:`~tqec.plaquette.plaquette.Plaquettes` instance and generates a
  :class:`~schedule.circuit.ScheduledCircuit` instance that corresponds to the
  circuit described.
- :func:`~.merge_scheduled_circuits` that is a function that helps merging
  several :class:`~schedule.circuit.ScheduledCircuit` instances containing gates
  that are potentially scheduled at the same time (but not on the same qubits).

Functions from this package are really the backbone of the :mod:`tqec`
library and are re-used in higher-level packages (such as :mod:`tqec.compile`).
