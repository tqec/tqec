    Note:
        We use the term "correlation surface", "pauli web" and "observable" interchangeably in
        the library.

    Here we represent the correlation surface by the set of edges it spans in the ZX graph.
    The insight is that the spiders pose parity constraints on the operators supported on
    the incident edges. The flow of the logical operators through the ZX graph, respecting
    the parity constraints, forms the correlation between the inputs and outputs. However,
    the sign of measurement outcomes is neglected in this representation. And we need to
    recover the measurements when instantiating an explicit logical observable from the
    correlation surface.

    Each edge establishes a correlation between the logical operators at the two ends of
    the edge. For example, an edge connecting two Z nodes represents the correlation
    between the logical Z operators at the two nodes.
