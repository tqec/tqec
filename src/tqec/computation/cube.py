    A cube is a high-level abstraction of a block of quantum operations within a
    specific spacetime volume. These operations preserve or manipulate the quantum
    information encoded in the logical qubits.

    For example, a single ``ZXZ`` kind cube can represent a quantum memory experiment for
    a surface code patch in logical Z basis. The default circuit implementation of the
    cube will consist of transversal Z basis resets, syndrome extraction cycles, and finally
    the Z basis transversal measurements. The spatial location of the physical qubits in the
    code patch and the time when the operations are applied are specified by the spacetime
    position of the cube.

    Attributes:
        position: The position of the cube in the spacetime. The spatial coordinates
            determines which code patch the operations are applied to, and the time
            coordinate determines when the operations are applied.
        kind: The kind of the cube. It determines the basic logical operations represented
            by the cube.
        label: The label of the cube. It's mainly used for annotating the input/output
