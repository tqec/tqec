    """Given a block graph with open ports, fill in the ports with the appropriate
    cubes that will minimize the number of simulation runs needed for the complete
    logical observable set.

    The key idea is that stabilizers within the same clique should have compatible
    Paulis at their ports. This allows a single simulation run to simultaneously
    simulate for all stabilizers in a clique. Minimizing the number of simulations,
    therefore, translates to minimizing the number of cliques while ensuring full
    coverage of all stabilizers. This leads to solving the minimum clique cover
    problem on a graph, which in turn reduces to a graph coloring problem on its
    complement.

    Args:
        graph: The block graph with open ports.
        search_small_area_observables: If True, the algorithm will try to construct
            all the possible correlation surfaces that can be used as logical
            observables and select the generators with the smallest area. This will
            result in constructing exponentially many correlation surfaces, which
            can be slow for graphs with large number of ports.

    Returns:
        A list of :class:`~tqec.computation.open_graph.FilledGraph` instances, each
        containing a block graph with all ports filled and a set of correlation
        surfaces that can be used as logical observables for the simulation on that
