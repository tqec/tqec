    """Find the correlation surfaces in a ZX graph.

    Starting from each leaf node in the graph, the function explores how can the X/Z logical observable
    move through the graph to form a correlation surface:

    - For a X/Z type leaf node, it can only support the logical observable with the opposite type. Only
      a single type of logical observable is explored from the leaf node.
    - For a Y type leaf node, it can only support the Y logical observable, i.e. the presence of
      both X and Z logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable are explored from the leaf node.
      And the two correlation surfaces are combined to form the Y type correlation surface.
    - For the BOUNDARY node, it can support any type of logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable
      are explored from it.

    The function uses a flood fill like recursive algorithm to find the correlation surface in the graph.
    Firstly, we define two types of nodes in the graph:

    - *broadcast node:* A node that has seen logical observable with basis opposite to its own basis.
      A logical observable needs to be broadcasted to all the neighbors of the node.
    - *passthrough node:* A node that has seen logical observable with the same basis as its own basis.
      A logical observable needs to be only supported on an even number of edges connected to the node.

    The algorithm starts from a set of frontier nodes and greedily expands the correlation
    surface until no more broadcast nodes are in the frontier. Then it explore the
    passthrough nodes, and select even number of edges to be included in the surface. If
    no such selection can be made, the search is pruned. For different choices, the algorithm
    recursively explores the next frontier until the search is completed. Finally, the branches
    at different nodes are produced to form the correlation surface.

    Args:
        g: The ZX graph to find the correlation surfaces.
        roots: The set of leaf nodes to start the correlation surface finding. If not provided,
            all the leaf nodes in the graph are used.
        reduce_to_minimal_generators: Whether to reduce the correlation surfaces to the minimal
            generators. Other correlation surfaces can be obtained by multiplying the generators.
            The generators are chosen to be the smallest in terms of the correlation surface area.
            Default is `True`.
