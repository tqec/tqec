# Note on the few functions below:
# These functions are needed mostly for typing purposes. The main issue is that
# all the type-checkers I tested are not able to infer the correct type in the
# situation below:
#
# obj: dict[int, int | float] = {}
# if all(isinstance(value, float) for value in obj.values()):
#     # We expect obj to be "dict[int, float]", but type checkers are not able
#     # to infer that.
#
# To circumvent that, the functions below use typing.TypeGuard (see
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeGuard).
