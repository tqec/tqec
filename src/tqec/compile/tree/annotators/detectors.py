            manhattan_radius: Parameter for the automatic computation of detectors.
                Should be large enough so that flows cancelling each other to

                most at a distance of ``manhattan_radius`` from the central

                so you should try to keep it to its minimum. A value too low might
                produce invalid detectors.
            detector_database: existing database of detectors that is used to
                avoid computing detectors if the database already contains them.
                Default to `None` which result in not using any kind of database
                and unconditionally performing the detector computation.
            lookback_size: number of QEC rounds to consider to try to find
                detectors. Including more rounds increases computation time.
