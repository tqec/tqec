"""Defines :class:`TopologicalComputationGraph` that represents a topological
computation.

## Design choices

A few choices have been made during the design phase of this code, and they
deeply impact the public interface. This section explains what are those choices
and why they have been made.

### Substitution VS removal

Before the introduction of :mod:`tqec.compile.blocks`, pipes (or junctions) were
never strictly instantiated in any public-facing data-structure. Internally, the
pipe implementation was instantiated but was directly used to **replace**
plaquettes from the 2 blocks that were touched by the pipe. This replacement
was encoded as a "substitution" that was a mapping from (potentially negative)
layer indices to a mapping of plaquettes (i.e., a mapping from indices found in
template instantiation to :class:`~tqec.plaquette.plaquette.Plaquette` instances).

With the introduction of layers as the base data-structure to represent QEC
rounds, the substitution approach started to show weaknesses. For example when
the layer schedules of a cube and one of its spatial pipe do not match.

This situation arise with spatial junctions: the central cube implements a
schedule that is

1. initialisation layer,
2. repeat [memory layer],
3. measurement layer,

whereas some of the pipes need to implement

1. initialisation layer,
2. repeat [memory layer 1 alternated with memory layer 2],
3. measurement layer.

The fact that the repeated layer have a different body rules out any possibility
to substitute plaquettes.

To solve that issue, spatial pipes do not substitute plaquettes in cubes but
rather remove the cube boundary and implement its own layers.

For temporal pipes, the layers are replaced in-place within block instances.
