class _DetectorDatabaseKey:
    """Immutable type used as a key in the database of detectors.

    This class represents a "situation" for which we might be able to compute
    several detectors. Its purpose of existence is to provide sensible
    `__hash__` and `__eq__` operations in order to be able to use a "situation"
    as a `dict` key.

    Attributes:
        subtemplates: a sequence of 2-dimensional arrays of integers representing
            the sub-template(s). Each entry corresponds to one QEC round.
        plaquettes_by_timestep: a list of :class:`Plaquettes`, each
            :class:`Plaquettes` entry storing enough :class:`Plaquette`
            instances to generate a circuit from corresponding entry in
            `self.subtemplates` and corresponding to one QEC round.

    ## Implementation details

    This class uses a surjective representation to compare (`__eq__`) and hash
    (`__hash__`) its instances. This representation is computed and cached using
    the :meth:`_DetectorDatabaseKey.plaquette_names` property that basically
    uses the provided subtemplates to build a nested tuple data-structure with
    the same shape as `self.subtemplates` (3 dimensions, the first one being the
    number of time steps, the next 2 ones being of odd and equal size and
    depending on the radius used to build subtemplates) storing in each of its
    entries the corresponding plaquette name.

    This intermediate data-structure is not the most memory efficient one, but
    it has the advantage of being easy to construct, trivially invariant to
    plaquette re-indexing and easy to hash (with some care to NOT use Python's
    default `hash` due to its absence of stability across different runs).
