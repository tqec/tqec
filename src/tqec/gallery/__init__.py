"""Collection of pre-built logical computations.

This module contains functions that build :py:class:`~tqec.computation.zx_graph.ZXGraph` and
:py:class:`~tqec.computation.block_graph.BlockGraph` instances representing the logical computations,
including:

- :mod:`.solo_node`: logical memory
- :mod:`.logical_cnot`: logical CNOT gate
- :mod:`.three_cnots`: three logical CNOT gates compressed in spacetime
