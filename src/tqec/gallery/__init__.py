"""Collection of pre-built logical computations.

This module contains functions that build :py:class:`~tqec.computation.block_graph.BlockGraph`
instances representing the logical computations, including:

- :mod:`.memory`: memory experiment
- :mod:`.stability`: stability experiment
- :mod:`.cnot`: logical CNOT gate
- :mod:`.cz`: logical CZ gate
- :mod:`.move_rotation`: rotate spatial boundaries by moving the logical qubit in spacetime
- :mod:`.three_cnots`: three logical CNOT gates compressed in spacetime
- :mod:`.steane_encoding`: Steane encoding circuit compressed in spacetime
