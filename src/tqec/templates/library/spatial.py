"""Provide functions building the :class:`~tqec.templates.rpng.RPNGTemplate`
instances representing spatial junctions and arms.

This module provides 2 functions to create
:class:`~tqec.templates.rpng.RPNGTemplate` instances:

- :func:`get_spatial_junction_qubit_template` that creates spatial junctions,
- and :func:`get_spatial_junction_arm_template` that creates the arms.

## Terminology

In this module, a **spatial junction** always refers to the logical qubit that
has at least 2 pipes in the spatial plane (``X`` or ``Y`` axis).

The pipes connected to the spatial junction are called **arms**.

    """Implementation of a logical qubit acting as a spatial junction.

    This function returns a RPNGTemplate instance representing a logical qubit
    connecting to others in space and forming a spatial junction. The returned
    template is carefully crafted to avoid hook errors damaging the logical
    distance.

    Note:
        this function does not enforce anything on the input values. As such, it
        is possible to generate a description of a round that will both reset and
        measure the data-qubits.

    Warning:
        By convention, this function does not populate the plaquettes on the
        boundaries where an arm is present **BUT** do populate the corners (that
        are part of the boundaries, so this is an exception to the first part of
        the sentence).

        The rationale behind that convention is that the logical qubit
        representing the spatial junction is completely aware of all the arms
        that should be implemented whereas each arm in isolation does not know
        if the other arms are present or not. That means that corners, whose
        plaquette depends on the presence or absence of the two arms it belongs
        to, require information that is given to this function, but not to the
        arm-generation function.

        Arms should follow that convention and should not replace the plaquette
        descriptions on the corners (i.e., not include an explicit mapping, even
        to the empty plaquette, from the index of the corner to a plaquette).


    Arguments:
        spatial_boundary_basis: stabilizers that are measured at each boundaries
            of the spatial junction.
        arms: flag-like enumeration listing the arms that are used around the
            logical qubit. The returned template will be adapted to be
            compatible with such a layout.
        reset: basis of the reset operation performed on data-qubits. Defaults
            to ``None`` that translates to no reset being applied on data-qubits.
        measurement: basis of the measurement operation performed on data-qubits.
            Defaults to ``None`` that translates to no measurement being applied
            on data-qubits.

        by convention, this function should **not** populate the plaquettes on
        the corners as :func:`get_spatial_junction_qubit_template` should take
        care of that.

    Warning:
        Using this function without :func:`get_spatial_junction_qubit_template`
        is very likely a programming error. Please double-check what you are
        doing if that is your case, in particular how the plaquettes on each
        corner of the center logical qubit are set.

    Arguments:
        spatial_boundary_basis: stabilizers that are measured at each boundaries
            of the spatial junction.
        arm: arm to return a spatial junction for. Should contain exactly
            **one** of the possible arm flags.
        reset: basis of the reset operation performed on **internal**
            data-qubits. Defaults to ``None`` that translates to no reset being
            applied on data-qubits.
        measurement: basis of the measurement operation performed on **internal**
            data-qubits. Defaults to ``None`` that translates to no measurement
            being applied on data-qubits.

    Raises:
        TQECException: if ``arm`` does not contain exactly 1 flag (i.e., if it
            contains 0 or 2+ flags).

    Returns:
        a description of the provided ``arm``.
