## Tactical Guidelines

### Opening PRs

**Template for Initial Comment on Issues:**
```markdown
Hi! I'd like to work on this issue.

Context: I recently had PR #726 merged (topologiq coordinate fix) and have
experience with [relevant area]. I have a solution ready that:
- [Specific improvement 1]
- [Specific improvement 2]
- Includes comprehensive tests

Would you like me to open a PR? Happy to coordinate with any ongoing work.
```

**PR Opening Strategy:**
1. Wait for positive response on issue (2-6 hours)
2. Open PR with detailed description
3. Reference your merged PR #726 for credibility
4. Include screenshots/examples if applicable
5. Make sure ALL tests pass before opening

### Responding to Feedback

**Always:**
- Respond within 4 hours during daytime
- Thank reviewers for their time

- Rush without testing
- Spam maintainers

### If Someone Claims Your Issue

**Be gracious:**
```markdown
No problem! Happy to help with testing/review if needed.
I'll work on [other issue] instead.
```

### If Feedback is Harsh

**Stay professional:**
```markdown

I'll revise to [solution]. Should have it ready in [timeframe].
