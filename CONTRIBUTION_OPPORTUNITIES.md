## Immediate Opportunities (Next 2 Weeks)

### üéØ Tier 1: High Impact, Low Effort (Sweet Spot)

#### 1. Issue #262: Improve Exception Expressiveness
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `help wanted`, `backend`, `QOL`  
**Why perfect for you**: You literally identified this need in your improvements doc!

**What**: Better error messages across TQEC  
**Your experience**: You proposed enhanced error messages for `read_from_lattice_dicts()`  
**Effort**: 4-8 hours per module  
**Impact**: HIGH - helps all users debug

**Concrete action**:
```python
# You already identified this for topologiq:
# Improvement 1.1 from POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md

# Expand to other modules:
# - src/tqec/compile/detectors/database.py (Mac/Linux issue #681)
# - src/tqec/compile/blocks/
# - src/tqec/computation/block_graph.py
```

**Strategy**:
1. Start with YOUR topologiq error messages (already designed)
2. Open small PR for that one module
3. After merge, propose pattern for other modules
4. Become "the error message person"

---

#### 2. Issue #263: Add Logging to the Code Base
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `backend`, `QOL`  
**Why perfect for you**: You proposed structured logging (Improvement 2.1)!

**What**: Add logging throughout TQEC  
**Your experience**: You designed logging for `read_from_lattice_dicts()`  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours per module  
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - easier debugging for everyone

**Concrete action**:
```python
# You already designed this:
# Improvement 2.1 from POTENTIAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md

# Implement for:
# 1. src/tqec/interop/pyzx/topologiq.py (your module)
# 2. src/tqec/interop/collada/read_write.py (similar pattern)
# 3. src/tqec/compile/graph.py (compilation logging)
```

**Strategy**:
1. Implement logging for topologiq (you know it best)
