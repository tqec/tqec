# LEGAL NOTICE

_Last updated: 07/27/2025_

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The TQEC (Topological Quantum Error Correction) library is an open-source software project made available for the advancement of **large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing**, particularly based on **surface code** and  **lattice surgery**.

This library is distributed to promote **academic, educational, and civilian research**. Its open accessibility reflects the contributors’ commitment to transparency, scientific progress, and global collaboration.

## 2. Permitted Uses

You may use, modify, and distribute this software under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), provided your use is strictly limited to:

- Academic or scientific research
- Educational instruction and student use
- Civilian research and development
- Open collaboration within the quantum computing community

## 3. Prohibited Uses

The following uses are **explicitly prohibited**, regardless of legality in your jurisdiction:

- Military, defense, or weapons-related development
- Surveillance, intelligence gathering, or national security infrastructure
- Dual-use technologies that may serve both civilian and military purposes
- Applications that violate international human rights, academic integrity, or ethical standards

The maintainers **do not authorize, endorse, or permit** any such uses. By using this software, you agree **not to engage in, support, or facilitate** these prohibited activities.

## 4. Export Control and Jurisdiction

This software is made publicly available as **fundamental research** and is therefore **not subject to U.S. export restrictions** under **15 CFR §734.3(b)(3)**, as it:

- (i) Is **published** (§734.7),
- (ii) Results from **fundamental research** (§734.8), and
- (iii) Is distributed **freely without access restrictions**.

In the European Union, **Regulation (EU) 2021/821** of the European Parliament and of the Council (20 May 2021) defines **dual-use items** as software or technology usable for both civil and military purposes, including nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons development. TQEC does **not fall under this classification** because:

- It is a **non-proprietary**, **open-source** tool intended exclusively for **academic, educational, and civilian research**; and
- It is not designed for use in any prohibited military or dual-use context.

In the United Kingdom, TQEC is also **not subject to export restrictions** under the **Export Control Act 2002** and the **Export Control Order 2008**. The software qualifies as publicly available academic research and is not listed in the UK Strategic Export Control Lists, as it:

- Is distributed without access limitations or commercial restrictions,
- Contains no encryption, surveillance, or defense-related functionality, and
- Is not intended for any dual-use or sensitive application.

> ⚠️ **Important**: These exemptions apply **only to the original, open-source version of TQEC**. Any modification, integration, or adaptation of TQEC into proprietary, commercial, or military-related systems may be subject to **U.S., EU, UK, or other national export and dual-use controls**.

All users and contributors are solely responsible for:

- Verifying compliance with relevant export, import, sanctions, and dual-use laws in their jurisdiction.
- Ensuring their use of TQEC does not involve restricted entities, embargoed countries, or prohibited technologies.
- Avoiding any use that may alter the regulatory status of the software.

## 5. Contributor Certification

By contributing to this repository, you certify that:

- You have the legal right to make the contribution.
- Your submission does not violate export control laws or proprietary rights.
- You are not acting on behalf of any military or surveillance-related organization.
- You understand and agree to comply with the prohibitions and responsibilities outlined in this notice.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability

This software is provided **“AS IS”**, without any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

The maintainers and contributors **accept no liability** for:

- Damage or loss resulting from the use or misuse of this software.
- Errors in compilation or simulation.
- Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
- Legal consequences arising from unauthorized or unlawful use.

Use of this software is at **your sole risk and responsibility**.

## 7. Final Remarks

TQEC is part of a shared global effort to advance fault-tolerant quantum computing for peaceful and ethical applications. We welcome collaboration from researchers, educators, and institutions who share this vision.

If you are uncertain about the legality or appropriateness of using this software in your context, please consult legal counsel or contact the maintainers before proceeding.
