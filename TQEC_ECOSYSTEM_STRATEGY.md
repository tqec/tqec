## Philosophy: Minimal Surface Area, Maximum Impact

> "Every line of code changes the mental model. The best fix is the smallest fix that makes the system more correct."

### Core Principles

1. **Minimal Surface Area**: Smallest possible change to fix real problems
2. **Elegant Solutions**: Subtle, robust fixes that feel obvious in retrospect
3. **Mental Model Alignment**: Changes should clarify, not confuse
4. **Test Judiciously**: Test behavior, not implementation details
5. **Documentation Over Code**: Sometimes a great README is better than code changes

### Why This Matters

In a distributed team:
- Each developer has a slightly different mental model
- Every code change shifts all mental models
- More changes = more bugs unless changes are clarifying
- The best code is code that doesn't need to be written

**Our Standard**: If we can't make it elegant and minimal, we don't ship it.

### Branch Naming Convention

**Format**: `{type}/{scope}-{issue-number}`

**Types**:
- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code cleanup (rare, must be justified)

**Examples**:
- `fix/topologiq-coordinate-transformation` ✅ (merged)
- `docs/contributing-guide-718`
- `feature/bfs-visualization`
- `perf/detector-search-parallel`

### Commit Message Standard

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Example** (your merged PR style):
```
fix(topologiq): correct pipe position calculation

- Changed from midpoint-based to direct endpoint transformation
- Matches proven pattern in collada/read_write.py
- Added 17 comprehensive tests covering edge cases

Fixes #723
```

**Philosophy**: Commit messages are documentation for future contributors

## Engineering Standards

### Before Every Contribution

**Ask Yourself**:
1. Is this the smallest possible fix?
2. Does this clarify or confuse the mental model?
3. Can this be solved with documentation instead?
4. Are we testing behavior or implementation?
5. Will this make sense in 6 months?

### Code Review Checklist

**For Every PR**:
- [ ] Change is minimal (smallest surface area)
- [ ] Mental model is clearer after change
- [ ] Tests prove correctness, not implementation
- [ ] Documentation explains WHY, not just WHAT
- [ ] No unnecessary abstractions
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] Can be reverted cleanly if needed

### Testing Philosophy

**Good Tests**:
- Test public APIs, not internals
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Test edge cases that actually occur
- Test integration points between modules
- Fail clearly when assumptions break

**Bad Tests**:
- Test private functions
- Mock everything (brittle)
- Test obvious cases only
- Tightly coupled to implementation
- Pass even when behavior is wrong

**Your PR #726 Tests**: Excellent example
- 17 tests, each proves specific behavior
- Cover edge cases (ports, different pipe directions)
- Integration-style (full pipeline)
- Would catch real bugs

## Cross-Repo Integration Points

### Critical Boundaries

**PyZX → topologiq**:
- Input: PyZX graph (ZX calculus)
- Transform: BFS to 3D spacetime
- Output: Lattice dictionary
- Your Fix: Coordinate transformation ✅

**topologiq → tqec**:
- Input: Lattice dictionary
- Transform: Build BlockGraph
- Output: TQEC BlockGraph
- Opportunity: More integration tests

**tqec → Stim**:
- Input: BlockGraph
- Transform: Compile to circuit
- Output: Stim circuit
- Uses: tqecd for detectors

**External → tqec**:
- SketchUp → COLLADA → tqec
- Qiskit → QASM → PyZX → topologiq → tqec
- Qrisp → same pipeline

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Within each repo
**Integration Tests**: Between repos (opportunity!)
**End-to-End Tests**: Full pipeline (big opportunity!)

- Write tests for test coverage sake
- Change code you don't understand
- Rush to show quantity over quality

**Do**:
- Make small, clear improvements
- Document before changing
- Ask questions when uncertain
- Test real behavior
- Learn deeply before contributing
- Focus on quality and elegance

### If Contributions Are Rejected

**Stay Professional**:
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Ask what would make it acceptable
- Learn from feedback
- Try smaller changes
- Document learnings

**Learn**:
- Why was it rejected?
- What did I misunderstand?
- How do maintainers think?
- What's their vision?
- How can I align better?
